# VectorRM
VectorRM is a lightweight, browser-based IT Risk Management platform built with React, Fastify, and SQLite. It enables organizations to identify, assess, track, and mitigate risks through a structured risk register, 5x5 risk matrix, audit trails, role-based access control, and compliance framework alignment, deployable locally with Node.js.
